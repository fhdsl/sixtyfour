A science-focused, more humane R interface to AWS.

## Installation

Development version

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("getwilds/sixtyfour")
```

## Setting the interface

The function `sixtyfour::set_s3_interface` makes it easier to toggle between S3 compatible backends; right now only supporting AWS S3 itself and [Minio](https://min.io/).
