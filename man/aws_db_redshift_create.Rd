\usage{
aws_db_redshift_create(
  id,
  user,
  pwd,
  dbname = "dev",
  cluster_type = "multi-node",
  node_type = "dc2.large",
  number_nodes = 2,
  security_group_ids = NULL,
  wait = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{(characteR) Cluster identifier. Use this identifier to refer to
the cluster for any subsequent cluster operations such as deleting or
modifying. The identifier also appears in the Amazon Redshift console.
Must be unique for all clusters within a Amazon Web Services account.}

\item{user}{(character) User name associated with the admin user account for
the cluster that is being created.}

\item{pwd}{(character) Password associated with the admin user account for
the cluster that is being created.}

\item{dbname}{(character) The name of the first database to be created when
the cluster is created. default: "dev". additional databases can be created
within the cluster}

\item{cluster_type}{(character) The type of the cluster: "single-node" or
"multi-node" (default).}

\item{node_type}{(character) The node type to be provisioned for the cluster.
defaul: "dc2.large"}

\item{number_nodes}{(integer/numeric) number of nodes; for multi-node
cluster type, this must be 2 or greater. default: 2}

\item{security_group_ids}{(character) VPC security group identifiers; one
or more. If none are supplied, you should go into your AWS Redshift
dashboard and add the appropriate VPC security group.}

\item{wait}{(logical) wait for cluster to initialize? default: \code{TRUE}. If
you don't wait (\code{FALSE}) then there's many operations you can not do
until the cluster is available. If \code{wait=FALSE} use \code{aws_db_cluster_status()} to
check on the cluster status.}
