aws_db_rds_create(
  id,
  class,
  user,
  pwd,
  dbname = "dev",
  engine = "mariadb",
  storage = 20,

\arguments{
\item{id}{(character) required. instance identifier. The identifier for
this DB instance. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.
Constraints: must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens; first
character must be a letter; cn't end with a hyphen or contain two
consecutive hyphens. required.}

\item{class}{(character) required. The compute and memory capacity of the
DB instance, for example \code{db.m5.large}.}

\item{user}{(character) User name associated with the admin user account for
the cluster that is being created.}

\item{pwd}{(character) Password associated with the admin user account for
the cluster that is being created.}

\item{dbname}{(character) The name of the first database to be created when
the cluster is created. default: "dev". additional databases can be created
within the cluster}

\item{engine}{(character) The engine to use. default: "mariadb". required.}

\item{storage}{(character) The amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB) to
allocate for the DB instance. default: 20}

\item{storage_encrypted}{(logical) Whether the DB instance is encrypted.
default: \code{TRUE}}

\item{security_group_ids}{(character) VPC security group identifiers; one
or more. If none are supplied, you should go into your AWS Redshift
dashboard and add the appropriate VPC security group.}

\item{wait}{(logical) wait for cluster to initialize? default: \code{TRUE}. If
you don't wait (\code{FALSE}) then there's many operations you can not do
until the cluster is available. If \code{wait=FALSE} use
\code{aws_db_instance_status()} to check on the cluster status.}

\item{verbose}{(logical) verbose informational output? default: \code{TRUE}}

\item{...}{named parameters passed on to

\value{
a list with methods for interfacing with RDS;
see \url{https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/rds/}. also prints useful
connection information after instance is available.

\details{
See above link to \code{create_cluster} docs for details on requirements
for each parameter

Note that even though you can use any option for \code{engine} in this function,
we may not provide the ability to connect to the chosen data source
in this package.
}
\section{Waiting}{

Note that with \code{wait = TRUE} this function waits for the instance to be
available for returning. That wait can be around 5 - 7 minutes. You can
instead set \code{wait = FALSE} and then check on the status of the instance
yourself in the AWS dashboard.
