\section{Blended vs. Unblended}{

\itemize{
\item Unblended: Unblended costs represent your usage costs on the day
they are charged to you
\item Blended: Blended costs are calculated by multiplying each accountâ€™s
service usage against something called a blended rate. A blended rate
is the average rate of on-demand usage, as well as Savings Plans- and
reservation-related usage, that is consumed by member accounts in an
organization for a particular service.
}
}

\section{Historical data}{

If you supply a \code{date_start} older than 14 months prior to today's date
you will likely see an error like "You haven't enabled historical data
beyond 14 months". See
\url{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/ce-advanced-cost-analysis.html} #nolint
for help
}

\section{Filtering}{

You can optionally pass a list to the \code{filter} argument to filter
AWS costs by different dimensions (see possible dimensions: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_GetDimensionValues.html)

This is supplied as a list of Dimensions, with key-value pairs for each
Dimension. For example, to only get "Usage" costs as opposed to credits,
tax refunds etc., use the \code{RECORD_TYPE} dimension Key and set the Value to
"Usage" (see examples)
