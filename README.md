A science-focused, more humane R interface to AWS.

## Installation

Development version

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("getwilds/sixtyfour")
```

This package is not on CRAN (yet)

## sixtyfour high level organization

- `aws_billing`: get AWS billing details
- `aws_bucket*`: manage S3 buckets
- `aws_file_*`: manage files in S3 buckets on AWS
- `aws_user*`: manage users on AWS
- `aws_db*`: interact with AWS databases


## Getting Started

You'll need two AWS secrets and the an AWS region:

```
Sys.setenv(
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "",
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "",
  AWS_REGION = "us-west-2"
)
```

## Setting the interface

The function `sixtyfour::set_s3_interface` makes it easier to toggle between S3 compatible backends; right now only supporting AWS S3 itself and [Minio](https://min.io/).
